# Flow around a cylinder

To run the case, execute the following command in the terminal:

*lmp_mpi <in.sdpd_phase.2d*

This case is used for dynamic validation of the model. This is a channel with a single-phase Poiseuille flow and a cylinder as an obstacle located in the middle of the geometry.  The flow is imposed by a body force f_g, which can be varied to obtain different fluid velocities. The validation of both vertical and horizontal velocity profiles can be seen in Figures A.14_(c) and A.14_(f), respectively.
