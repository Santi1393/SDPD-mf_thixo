# Surface tension of a droplet

To run the case, execute the following command in the terminal:

*lmp_mpi <in.sdpd_phase.2d*

This case is used for static validation of the model. It involves a droplet submerged in another fluid, whose surface tension is measured and then theoretically validated using the Young-Laplace equation. The current code reproduces the result for a droplet of r=25 $\Delta x$ and $\sigma=1$, and the result can be seen in Figure 1 (a). To reproduce all the points on the graph, simply vary the surface tension and radius values.
