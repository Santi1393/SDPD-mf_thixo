# Droplet merging using micro-devices

To run the case, execute the following command in the terminal:

*lmp_mpi <in.sdpd_phase.2d*

This is the fourth exploratory case that we study with our model. This corresponds to the merging process of Newtonian and thixotropic droplets. The system consists of a chamber with pillars that slow down the first droplet and allow the second droplet to penetrate and generate the mixture, as can be seen in Figure 13. To observe different configurations of the output droplet, vary the thixotropic properties of the droplets.
