# Emulsion with newtonian continuous phase and thixotropic droplets

To run the case, execute the following command in the terminal:

*lmp_mpi <in.sdpd_phase.2d*

This is the second exploratory case that we study with our model. This corresponds to the transport of thixotropic droplets immersed in a continuous Newtonian phase. Figure 9 shows the difference between starting the simulation with the microstructure formed $f_0=1$ and not formed $f_0=0$. To reproduce the graph, the factor $f_0$ must be varied.
