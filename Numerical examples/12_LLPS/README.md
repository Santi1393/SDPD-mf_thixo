# Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS)

To run the case, execute the following command in the terminal:

*lmp_mpi <in.sdpd_phase.2d*

This is the first exploratory case that we study with our model. This example reproduces a case of LLPS starting from a random system and progressing to a stable system with well-formed droplets. This behavior varies depending on the selection of the main parameters. To obtain the behaviors reflected in the paper, vary fundamental parameters such as surface tension, $k_BT$, $\alpha$, and any others indicated in the manuscript.
