# Droplet dynamics in a periodically constricted channel

To run the case, execute the following command in the terminal:

*lmp_mpi <in.sdpd_phase.2d*

This is the third exploratory case that we study with our model. This corresponds to the transport of a droplet through a chamber that changes cross-section. In the widest area, the droplet relaxes and tends toward a circular shape. The case presented here reproduces the dynamics of the droplet with $\lambda_{thixo}=200$ and $\beta=100$. The temporal evolution of viscosity can be observed in Figure 12. To reproduce this figure and Figure 11, vary the values of $\lambda_{thixo}$ and $\beta$.
